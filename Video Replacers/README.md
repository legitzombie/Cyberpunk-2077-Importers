This error happens when the script completes with an empty video folder. 

Run the script again and make sure you save the .bk2 in the right folder.

# Video / Image shows up but gets replaced

Cause: You have conflicting mods, you need to install the mod manually on Vortex and set load order to after everything when prompted.
